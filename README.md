# Console Mode

Turn your Windows PC into a **game console** with one click: focus the TV, turn off the other screens, switch the audio and launch your game UI. Quit the game and your desk comes back on its own.

## Download

Get **[1.5.0](https://github.com/lippdev/consolemode/releases/tag/v1.5.0)**, the latest stable version:

- **`ConsoleMode-Setup-x64.exe`** (recommended): per-user install, no admin, updates itself.
- **`ConsoleMode-Portable-x64.exe`**: a single exe that keeps its data next to it.

On 1.4.0? The app offers the update. If it fails with a timeout, download the installer once; your settings are kept.

Windows 10 or 11, plus [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) (Big Picture), [Playnite](https://playnite.link/) or the Xbox app. [RTSS](https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/rtss-rivatuner-statistics-server-download.html) is optional, for the FPS limit.

## How it works

1. Open the app and pick the screen you play on. The others turn off.
2. Press **Play now**, or use the one-click desktop shortcut. The first time on a new screen, the TV asks "Can you see this screen?" and reverts on its own if nobody answers.
3. Quit Big Picture or Playnite and everything goes back: screens, audio, resolution.

Prefer the couch? With the app in the tray, hold the controller's Home button and it starts from there.

| Controller shortcut | Does |
|---|---|
| Hold **Home** (Xbox / PS) | Enter console mode from the tray |
| Hold **Select + Y** (Create + △) | Menu over the game: volume, resolution, audio, FPS, HDR, exit |
| Hold **Start + Select** (Options + Create) | Back to the PC |

- English, Portuguese and Spanish
